# Code promotion and integration

**Learning objectives:**

-   Describe the **three environments** used in software development and data science.
-   Use **GitHub Actions (GHA) to deploy** data science assets.
-   Keep environments in sync using **infrastructure as code (IaC) tooling.**

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.
