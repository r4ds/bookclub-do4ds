# Code promotion and integration

**Learning objectives:**

-   Describe the **three environments** used in software development and data science.
-   Use **GitHub Actions (GHA) to deploy** data science assets.
-   Keep environments in sync using **infrastructure as code (IaC) tooling.**

## Why Do We Care About Code Promotion Workflows? {-}

- Without foresight, live products can break. Users sad; supervisors mad.
- Code promotion reduces the risk of disaster by:
    - Modularizing processes
    - Testing & checking rigorously
    - Minimizing downtime

### Dev {-}

- The _development environment_ is the product sandbox
- Most "data science" happens here:
    - Data analysis & modeling
    - App prototyping
    - ETL

Comparing dev for data science vs dev for software engineering:

    <figcaption>Most of what data scientists do doesn't end up as a live product in the state it was created; these entities think differently! ([Source](https://www.productboard.com/blog/orchestrating-ml-workflows-with-airflow/))</figcaption>

### Test {-}

- Test is for testing :)

- Tests used for many reasons incl. security, portability, performance, usability

### Prod {-}

- Gold standard (where your live product is released into the wild)
- Should be guarded by Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Ideally zero manual interaction and zero changes to the actual code

## CI/CD {-}

- Most CI/CD processes are usually managed with git:

    <figcaption>There are a handful of [git workflow patterns](https://rovitpm.com/5-git-workflows-to-improve-development/) for DevOps (Image Source: [The book!](https://do4ds.com/chapters/sec1/1-1-code-promotion.html#cicd-and-the-mechanics-of-code-promotion))</figcaption>
</figure>

CI/CD processes are "triggered" by git changes (i.e. when code changes in `test`)

- GitHub is the leading provider for CI/CD via GitHub Actions (GHA)

### How Does it Work? {-}

You write code that tells the CI/CD tool to:

1. Build a clean, empty server on the cloud
2. Copy your code with new changes and the bare-minimum requirements for it to run
3. Install and run any tests as specified; if tests fail, stop immediately and inform the developer
4. Accept the new changes and "push" to production (automatically copy the changes to the live product)

`r-lib` üì¶ is your friend for getting started with GHA with R ‚Äî See [here](https://github.com/r-lib/actions)

## Per-Environment Configuration {-}

- When servers are "stood up" by CI/CD, they can take many forms
- It's wise to test these forms for your users
- How do you flexibly code CI/CD to test many forms? `config` üì¶ in R is your friend, use it to set environment variables^[We'll probably learn more about environment variables in chapter 7 + 8]

## Creating & Maintaining Identical Environments {-}

- Servers should be cattle; not sheep/environments are pocket change
    - Servers should be unremarkable, used frequently and interchangeably
- Test environments should be identical to production; therefore, never fiddle with test when tests fail
    - Doing so introduces servers to _drift out of alignment_
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) are tools meant to manage these servers and changes
