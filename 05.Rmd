# Docker for Data Science

**Learning objectives:**

-   Decide whether a container is the right tool for a given job.
-   Download and run pre-built Docker images.
-   Describe the stages of the Docker container lifecycle.
-   Build simple Dockerfiles for your own projects.

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.
