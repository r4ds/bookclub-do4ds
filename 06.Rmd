# Getting Started with the Cloud

**Learning objectives:**

-   Recognize **why** you might (and might not) want to **host services in the cloud.**
-   Differentiate between **IaaS, PaaS,** and **SaaS.**
-   List some **common cloud services.**
-   Start and stop and **EC2 instance** on AWS.

## Quick Section Overview

> So this section is really targeting the student who wants to **host a project for portfolio purposes,** the hobbyist who's **hosting a toy project,** or the data science leader who **has no choice but to host things for themselves because they just can't get IT/Admin support.**

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ I've been two of those things in the last year!

## Why cloud?

-   It probably isn't cheaper.
-   It's faster and easier.
    -   No need to wait for new hardware to arrive and be installed.
