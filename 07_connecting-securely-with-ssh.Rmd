# Connecting Securely with SSH

**Learning objectives:**

-   Understand what SSH is and why we use it
-   Find out the difference between a public key and a private key
-   Appreciate *how* SSH encryption works

## SSH

Stands for 'Secure (socket) Shell'

Two-way communication between your computer and a remote server.

When interacting with the server we use Linux commands.

SSH allows us to interact with the server privately, to prevent bad actors from performing... bad acts!

## Keys

SSH works by the exchange of ~~Cryptocurrencies~~ cryptographic keys ![Not this](images/ssh_not_bitcoin.png)

SSH Keys come in two parts - public and private, so we call them public keys and private keys.

## What's the difference?

The private key is for you, public keys are shareable.

The private key comprises two large prime numbers

The public key is the product of those two primes, so is by definition not a prime number.

## When should you move your private key?

When  f(x) = 1/x = 0


## Public keys as locks

Alex points out that Private key and Public key are needlessly similar, making them potentially difficult to recall. Hello sensitivity and specificity.

It's better to think of private keys as keys, public keys as locks

![One to many](images/ssh_key_padlocks.jpeg)
There should only be one private key, but there can be many public keys.

## Practical SSH Usage

First key pairs are created - Private & Public

Then the public key is added to the servers .ssh/authorized_keys file

Keys are then shared with the server admin, if you are the server admin, congratulations the keys are shared with you!

Keys ship with a default name e.g. `id_ed25519`, best to stick with this name. Check book for -i workaround.

It's possible to include usernames and addresses in a config file, i.e.
instead of tpying `ssh alexkgold@do4ds-lab.shop` I can just type `ssh lab`.

## Comprehension Questions:

Under what circumstances should you move or share your SSH private key?
What is it about SSH public keys that makes them safe to share?
