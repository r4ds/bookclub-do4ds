# Getting Comfortable on the Command Line

-   The structure of `bash` commands
-   Referencing directories and files
-   Reading text files
-   Moving and copying files
-   Server Files
-   Writing files

## `bash` Commands {.unnumbered}

-   The general structure: `<command> <flags + flag args> <command args>`
    -   `command`: What to do
    -   `flags + flag args`: Options for the command and options for those options
    -   `command args`: arguments to pass to the command

### Listing files in the current directory {-}

We want to list files in the specified directory. The `bash` command to list files is `ls`.

#### R {.unnumbered}

-   `command`: `list.files()`
-   `flags + flag args`: `all.files = TRUE`
-   `command args`: `".github"`

```{r}
list.files(".github", all.files = TRUE)
```

#### bash {.unnumbered}

-   `command`: `ls`
-   `flags + flag args`: `-a`
-   `command args`: `.github`

```{bash}
ls -a .github
```

### Long Commands {.unnumbered}

-   Long commands are split onto multiple lines with a trailing backslash

<!-- -->

    this is a \
      really really \
      long command

## Directories and Files {.unnumbered}

| Where am I?                             | Reference |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Where was I born?                       | `/`       |
| What town do I live in?                 |           |
| Where do I live?                        | `~`       |
| Where am I now?                         | `.`       |
| Where was I just before where I am now? | `..`      |

\*There's no easy way to access your current mount point

### What if you were a file? {-}

Let's say you are this file: `/r4ds/do4ds/cohort1/chapter8.Rmd`

| File System Root | Drive | Home Folder | Folder (Your Room) | File         |
|------------------|-------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|
| /                | r4ds  | do4ds       | cohort1            | chapter8.Rmd |

Revisiting the "Where am I? table"

| Where am I?                             | Reference |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Where was I born?                       | `/`       |
| What town do I live in?                 | `r4ds`    |
| Where do I live?                        | `do4ds`   |
| Where am I now?                         | `cohort1` |
| Where was I just before where I am now? | `do4ds`   |

#### What if you have a sudden urge to see the world? {.unnumbered}

The `bash` command to change directories is `cd` . In this case, you start at `/r4ds/do4ds/cohort1` which is the directory for your (`chapter8.Rmd`) bedroom.

| Quest                                                                                                                    | Directions              |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Visiting your cousin in `cohort2`                                                                                        | `cd ../cohort2`         |
| Visiting your second cousin in the `advr/cohort1` bookclub                                                               | `cd ../../advr/cohort1` |
| You've gotten lost and don't know where you are and need directions to your second cousin in the `advr/cohort1` bookclub | `cd /r4ds/advr/cohort1` |
| Stopping by the hospital where you were born because they have great grilled cheese sandwiches in the cafeteria          | `cd /`                  |
| Going back to your room                                                                                                  | `cd ~/cohort1`          |

Any path with `..` is a relative path and only works from your current directory.

## Reading Text Files {.unnumbered}

Let's take a look at `pr_check.yml` in our `.github/workflows` folder:

```{bash}
cat .github/workflows/pr_check.yml
```

### The Pipe {.unnumbered}

-   Linux offers a pipe, `|`, similar to that of R and other functional languages
    -   `take the output of this | and give it to this as an input`

To find the workflow branch:

```{bash}
cat .github/workflows/pr_check.yml | grep branches
```

To show just the first six items in our current folder:

```{bash}
ls -a | head -n 6
```

Notice that `bash` returns the current folder and the parent folder as items.

## Moving and Copying Files {.unnumbered}

Let's say you are this file: `/r4ds/do4ds/cohort1/chapter8.Rmd`

| File System Root | Drive | Home Folder | Folder (Your Room) | File         |
|------------------|-------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|
| /                | r4ds  | do4ds       | cohort1            | chapter8.Rmd |

#### What if you do some remodeling at home? {.unnumbered}

The `rm` command will remove something, with the options to do so recursively (`-r`) or to force it (`-f`). You can also copy (`cp`), move (`mv`), or make or remove directories (`mkdir` and `rmdir`).

| Construction Phase                                   | Command                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Move everything out of the kitchen into a spare room | `mv ~/kitchen/* ~/spare_room`                 |
| Remove the kitchen appliances                        | `rm ~/kitchen/stove.app ~/kitchen/fridge.app` |
| Demolish the kitchen                                 | `rmdir ~/kitchen`                             |
| Make a new kitchen                                   | `mkdir ~/kitchen`                             |
| Move everything into the new kitchen                 | `mv ~/spare_room/* ~/kitchen`                 |

You `mv` or `cp` `from_here to_here`

## Server Files {.unnumbered}

- Moving things as one big file has much better throughput than many small files
  - Imagine sending someone a care package. You could send them individual items or one big box. The one big box is much easier to manage.
- `tar` packs and unpacks tarball files
  - Pack (create): `tar -czf <archive name> <file(s)>`
  - Unpack (extract): `tar -xfv <archive name>`
  
- `scp` stands for "secure copy" and is a combination of `ssh` and `cp`

## Writing Files {.unnumbered}

### With the Command Line {.unnumbered}

- `touch` creates a file
- `>` is similar to pipe, but it will write to a file
- `>>` is also similar to pipe, but it wall append to a file

```{bash eval=FALSE}
touch file.txt
echo "this goes in the file" > file.txt
echo "this also goes in the file" >> file.txt
```


### With Command Line Text Editors {.unnumbered}

- There are several text editors such as `vi`, `vim`, and `nano` that work directly in the command line
  - Some are easier to use than others
  
To exit vim:
1. Hit the `escape` key on your keyboard
2. Type one of these, making sure to include the `:`
  - To write AND quit: `:wq`
  - To quit without having made changes: `:q`
  - To quit and not save changes: `:q!`
  
It's okay if you don't remember.
