# Basic Linux SysAdmin

**Learning objectives:**

-   Admin stuff that I won't dig into:
    -   Create users in Linux.
    -   Check and set Linux file permissions.
    -   Install programs on Debian-based Linux distributions.
    -   Check storage usage.
    -   Manage processes.
    -   Implement SSH port forwarding.
    -   Locate files on the `$PATH`.
-   Set up a data science AWS EC2.
    -   Run RStudio on an AWS EC2.
    -   Run JupyterHub on an AWS EC2.
    -   Run a plumber API in a docker container on an AWS EC2.

## Stand up an EC2 (chapter 10 lab review) {-}

-   Sign in at [console.aws.amazon.com](console.aws.amazon.com)
-   Go to EC2 (via services or other routes)
-   "Launch instances"
-   Fill in the form:
    -   Name (`do4ds-lab`)
    -   AMI: `ubuntu`
    -   Type: `t2.micro` is free, might need larger later.
    -   Key pair: Choose or create. `pem` version no matter what you're on.
    -   Security group: Choose or create.
    -   Storage: For now we aren't using anything more than the root.
        -   We'll add more when we need it in a later lab.
        -   It's fine if you already added some, though.
    -   "Launch instance"
-   "Instance state" menu to stop or terminate between labs.

## Create a non-root user {-}

-   ("Instance state" > "Start instance" to resume)
-   Copy "Public IPv4 DNS" (will be `$SERVER_ADDRESS` below)
    -   something like "ec2-3-123-456-789.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
-   `ssh -i ~/path/to/do4ds-lab-key.pem ubuntu@$SERVER_ADDRESS`
-   `sudo adduser test-user`
    -   Give them a password
    -   Defaults ok for everything else
-   `sudo usermod -aG sudo test-user` (`a`dd to `G`roup)

## Add an ssh key {-}

-   Create new key *from your local machine* (if you don't have one):
    -   On Windows: `ssh-keygen` works but it's fussy
    -   I named it `id_rsa_test_user` (but then I reverted to my personal `id_rsa`!)
    -   I didn't use a password
-   `scp` the key to the server
    -   `scp -i ~/path/to/do4ds-lab-key.pem ~/path/to/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@@$SERVER_ADDRESS:/home/ubuntu`
-   On server:
    -   `mv` & `chown` to user
    -   `su test-user` & `cd ~`
    -   `mkdir -p .ssh`, `chmod 700 .ssh`, `cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys`
    -   `chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys`
    -   `rm id_rsa.pub`

## Notes on personal ssh key {-}

-   ~~I still need `-i ~/path/to/id_rsa_test_user` in `ssh` call~~
-   ~~Is this because I haven't "set up an SSH config for this server"?~~
-   Update: Nope! It was because I had 2 keys in my local`.ssh` folder

## Install R {-}

-   `curl -Ls https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases/download/latest/rig-linux-arm64-latest.tar.gz | sudo tar xz -C /usr/local`
-   `rig add release`
-   `R`

## Install RStudio Server {-}

-   Check [current installation instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-server/)
-   `sudo apt-get install gdebi-core`
-   `wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/jammy/amd64/rstudio-server-2022.12.0-353-amd64.deb`
-   `sudo gdebi rstudio-server-2022.12.0-353-amd64.deb`
-   `sudo systemctl status rstudio-server`
-   `rm rstudio-server-2022.12.0-353-amd64.deb`

## Tunnel to see it locally {-}

-   On your local machine:
    -   `ssh -NL 8787:localhost:8787 test-user@$SERVER_ADDRESS`
    -   I had to add the `N`, I'm not sure what it does (got it from Google)
-   [It's alive!](http://localhost:8787/)

## Install Python and JupyterLab {-}

-   I did not do this and hope to never do this.

## Plumber in docker {-}

-   `sudo apt-get install docker.io`
    -   `sudo docker ps` to make sure it worked

```
sudo docker run --rm -d \
  -p 8555:8000 \
  --name palmer-plumber \
  alexkgold/plumber
```

-   `ssh -NL 8555:localhost:8555 test-user@$SERVER_ADDRESS`
-   [It's an api!](http://localhost:8555/__docs__/)
