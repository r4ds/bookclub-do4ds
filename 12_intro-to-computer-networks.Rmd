# Intro to Computer Networks

**Learning objectives:**

-   Details that we won't dig into:
    -   Describe the pieces of a URL.
    -   Briefly explain how ports map to services.
    -   Outline how IP addresses map to servers.
    -   Troubleshoot common network problems.
-   Use `nginx` to make multiple services available from a single server.
    -   Install `nginx` on an Ubuntu server.
    -   Allow outside traffic to reach `nginx` on our AWS EC2.
    -   Route traffic to RStudio via `nginx.conf`.
    -   Route traffic to JupyterHub via `nginx.conf` (skipped here).
    -   Route traffic to a plumber api via `nginx.conf`.

## Install nginx {-}

-   *(Make sure the server from Chapter 11 is running, with RStudio & the plumber API.)*
-   `ssh test-user@$SERVER_ADDRESS`
-   `sudo apt install nginx`

## Allow outside traffic {-}

-   *(Log into console.aws.amazon.com and navigate to EC2/Instances)*
-   Click the "Security" tab on your instance.
-   Click the Security group (something like `launch-wizard-2`)
    -   (or go directly to "Network & Security"/"Security Groups")
-   "Inbound rules" > "Edit inbound rules"
-   "Add rule"
    -   "HTTP", "Anywhere-IPv4"
    -   "HTTPS", "Anywhere-IPv4" while we're in here (won't work yet, though)

## Edit nginx.conf {-}

-   `sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx-backup.conf`
-   `sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
    -   Delete everything below the `events` block (`80dd`).
-   Set up http basics.

```
http {
  
  # Enable websockets (needed for Shiny) -- I don't know if this part matters.
  map $http_upgrade  $connection_upgrade { 
    default upgrade; '' close; 
  }
  
  server { listen 80;
  
    # You can edit this file if you want a default page.
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html index.htm;
  
    # I think this was necessary to get it to work.
    # We'll do more with this in Chapter 13.
    server_name ec2-12-345-678-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com;
  }
}
```

-   `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
-   Test it at your "Public IPv4 DNS".

## Add RStudio routing {-}

-   Add a `location` block inside the `http` / `server` section of `nginx.conf`.

```
    location /rstudio/ {
      # Needed only for a custom path prefix of /rstudio
      rewrite ^/rstudio/(.*)$ /$1 break;
      
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8787;
      
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_read_timeout 20d;
      
      # Not needed if www-root-path is set in rserver.conf
      proxy_set_header X-RStudio-Root-Path /rstudio;
      
      # Optionally, use an explicit hostname and omit the port if using 80/443
      proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port;
    }
```

-   `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
-   Test it at your "Public IPv4 DNS" `/rstudio`.

## Add plumber api routing {-}

-   Add a `location` block each time you want to add an API.

```
    location /palmer/ {
      # Check the book to see if he has added more!
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8555/;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
```

-   `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
-   Test it at your "Public IPv4 DNS" `/palmer/stats` and `/palmer/__docs__/`.
