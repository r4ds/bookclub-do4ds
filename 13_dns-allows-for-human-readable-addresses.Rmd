# DNS allows for human-readable addresses

**Learning objectives:**

-   Details that we won't dig into:
    -   Describe the pieces of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
    -   Explain why DNS changes can take a long time to propagate.
    -   Use DNS records to route traffic to a domain.
-   Configure a domain name for an AWS EC2.
    -   Allocate an Elastic IP.
    -   Configure DNS records to route traffic to an AWS EC2.

## Allocate an Elastic IP {-}

-   *(Make sure the server from Chapter 12 is running, with `/rstudio` & `/palmer` via `nginx`)*
-   Navigate to "EC2" > "Network & Security" > "Elastic IPs"
-   "Allocate Elastic IP Address" (and click "Allocate")
-   "Actions" / "Associate Elastic IP Address"
    - Find the instance
-   To clean up, you can do "Actions" / "Release Elastic IP Addresses"

## Configure DNS Records {-}

-   *(Register a domain)*
-   Find the "DNS" settings for that domain at your registrar
-   Add or edit 3 records:
    -   A * `12.345.678.90`
    -   A @ `12.345.678.90`
    -   CNAME www `yourdomain.you`

## Reconfigure nginx {-}

-   `sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
-   `server_name ec2.whatever;` to `server_name yourdomain.you www.yourdomain.you;`
-   `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
-   Visit `http://yourdomain.you/rstudio` and `http://yourdomain.you/palmer/stats`
    - Chrome will yell at you since https won't work yet. See the next chapter!
