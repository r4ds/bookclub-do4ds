# Open Source Data Science in the Enterprise

**Learning objectives:**

-   What are sandboxes and why should we use them?
-   What is the code promotion process?
-   How does software licensing affect the work you do?
-   What are some concerns to keep in mind when using free open-source software?

## Data Science Sandboxes {.unnumbered}

-   Keep dev/test/prod separated

Three components to a sandbox:

1.  free read-only access to real data
2.  broad access to packages
3.  production code promotion process

## Read-only access {-} 

-   The last thing you want to do is mess up production data

-   This gives you the access you need without the worry

-   Any writes are contained to the sandbox

-   You can also protect your data in completely offline environments

    -   Fun fact: Some PCs have to be so secure that they're considered insecure if they've ever connected to any kind of network ever

## Package availability {-}

-   You may have package restrictions (understandable, but :( all the same)
    -   Security
    -   Correctness
    -   Maintenance
-   Free reign in dev is great
    -   You can keep track of what you use with `renv` or `venv`

## Promotion {-}

-   How do you promote code from dev to test to prod?

-   Usually only admins get prod access

-   Always best to discuss a promotion strategy when getting started

    -   Discussed in chapter 1

## Dev/Test/Prod for Admins {-}

-   Just like you want to keep your package environment safe, admins want your system kept safe
    -   Servers, OS, R/Python, etc
    
- Promotion matrix
  - IT/Admins can upgrade the environment separately from the data science tooling
  - IT/Admins like to call development and testing "staging"
  
- This is where DevOps for Data Science starts to become regular DevOps
  - Infrastructure as code
  
## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) {-}

- To get a server to be useful you need two things:
  1. Provision (create) the infrastructure
  2. Configure the infrastructure
- No clear dividing line between provisioning and configuring tools
- Docker is part of IaC, but you still need a deployment framework and hypervisor or other container management software
- IaC should be deployed with CI/CD, but doesn't have to be
- You're not safe from your own bad habits
  
Shiny example:

1. Set up a server
2. Configure network settings
  - Security
  - Ports
  - Anything else
3. Install R (or Python or whatever)
4. Install Shiny
5. Hosting software

## Open Source in Enterprise {-}

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.

But try to be aware of the licenses your software and packages are under

Four FOSS freedoms:

1. View and inspect source code
2. Run the software
3. Modify the software
4. Redistribute the software

General categories:

- Permissive: You can do basically whatever you want
  - Examples: MIT, Apache, BSD
- Copyleft: Derivative works must use the same license
  - Examples: GPL, AGPL
  
- Not something you want to mess with
- Things get confusing when mixing licenses

## Package Restrictions {-}

- To restrict package access, IT Admins must:
  - Restrict access to public repositories
  - Provide an alternative!
    - Don't worry about space needed for packages. Most are small
      - I have 421 packages taking up ~2GB
- Lots of kinds of enterprise repository software

Two main concerns:

- Managing vulnerabilities
  - Code scanners vs common vulnerabliities vs common sense
- Licenses
- Maintenance/lifetime
