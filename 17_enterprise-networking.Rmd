# Enterprise Networking

**Learning objectives:**

-   Understand enterprise networking terminology.
-   List some benefits of private networks and proxies.
-   Recognize issues related to inbound proxies.
-   Recognize issues related to outbound proxies.

## Enterprise Networking Terminology {-}

-   **private network:** a network that *communicates* with the wider internet *via proxies;* VPC ("Virtual private cloud") on AWS 
-   **inbound proxy:** more formally "reverse proxy"; a server on the public network that routes traffic *into* a private network
-   **outbound proxy:** more formally "forward proxy"; a server on the public network that routes traffic *out of* a private network

## Benefits of Private Networks {-}

-   Deal with security issues at the proxies
-   Easier to route traffic (and change routing) to specific servers
-   Easier to manage ports
-   Can block traffic to/from specific unwanted sources
    -   Or block all traffic and only allow specific white lists
-   Can optionally handle authentication at the proxy & pass token/header along

## Issues with Inbound Proxies {-}

-   Connections from your laptop to the server
-   Things that are often configured:
    -   Upload/download file size limits.
    -   Upload/download/session timeouts.
-   Signs that you might be fighting against an inbound proxy:
    -   Uploads/downloads from you to the server fail or cut off early.
    -   Your session keeps ending (you have to log back in).
-   Special case: Websockets
    -   Older proxies might break things like Shiny and Streamlit.

## Issues with Outbound Proxies {-}

-   Connections from server to the internet
-   Rare than inbound.
    -   "Air-gapped" often means "strong outbound proxy."
-   Things that can be impacted:
    -   Downloading packages (other than from internal package manager).
    -   Accessing external data (APIs).
    -   Updating system libraries (hopefully your IT has a plan for this).
    -   Software licensing (software might ping a server).
-   IT often open to allowing access to specific URLs, so ask!
