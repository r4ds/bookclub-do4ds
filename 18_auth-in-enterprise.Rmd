# Auth in Enterprise

**Learning objectives:**

- What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- What are some different ways to manage permissions? What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?
- What is some advantages of token-based auth? Why are most organizations adopting it? Are there any drawbacks?
- For each of the following, is it a username + password method or a token method? PAM, LDAP, Kerberos, SAML, ODIC/OAuth

## Introduction {-}

- The goal of Auth is to manage two desires: everybody should be able to do their work, but nobody should be able to work on something they're not supposed to
- People leave, join, change roles frequently. Having one person with the key to every room is impractical (and unsafe)
- In "least privilege", people only get access to the things they _need_ and nothing they don't
- Auth is all about systems that balance these needs

## LDAP/AD {-}

- Authentication = knowing _who_ is requesting access to something they need
- Authorization = checking if that person should have access to the thing they're asking for
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Access Directory (AD) centralizes security by having everyone need only one "key" for every room (one set of username-password credentials)
  - Authentication is improved, but authorization is not
  - The communication between the device and the server is not guaranteed to be secure
  - You still need to check credentials at each room repeatedly

## Single Sign On (SSO) {-}

- SSO is like getting a key card at the front desk for the day
  - The card is given to you if your credentials are correct (authenticated)
  - Card maintains your credentials throughout the day
  - Card already knows which rooms you need access to (authorized)
- Managed by browser's tokens:
  - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0, in XML)
  - Open Identity Connect (OIDC, OAuth2.0, in JSON)
- External services like Okta, OneLogin, Azure Active Directory are vendors

## Permissions {-}

- Simple permissions management is just a list e.g. Access Control List (ACL)
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC) defines groups of permissions by person e.g. manager, intern, executive
  - More flexible and simple at first
  - Complexity creep for each person who thinks they're "special"
- Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) defines permissions for combinations of the person, task, data, etc.
  - e.g. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) aims to balance complexity with security

## Why should we care? {-}

- Your org should be able to equip you with the **tools** required to be a creative and effective data scientist without jeopardizing their privacy/security
- Data access, of course
  - Internal data sources often only need LDAP-like credentials (not SSO)
  - Some orgs use Kerberos to create SSO-like tokens for data
  - Others still use JSON Web Token (JWT) â€” rare but still new
  - IAM is often used for cloud-to-cloud security
- Service accounts are software that needs permission to do things by itself
  - e.g. you don't want to have to sign in yourself for every user who wants to use your secure Shiny app

## Learning Objectives {-}

- What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
  - Authentication = who is asking?
  - Authorization = what do you want to do?
- What are some different ways to manage permissions? What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?
  - In order of complexity: ACL, RBAC, ABAC
- What is some advantages of token-based auth? Why are most organizations adopting it? Are there any drawbacks?
  - Reduces complexity by providing one "handshake", but doesn't solve everything (e.g. data access, token management)
- For each of the following, is it a username + password method or a token method? PAM, LDAP, Kerberos, SAML, ODIC/OAuth

PAM = username + password

LDAP = username + password

Kerberos = Token

SAML = Token

ODIC/OAuth = Token
