(If you're not comfortable sharing, skip)\n  - How long have you been using R?\n  - What was your introduction to R?\n  - What are you most looking forward to during the club?\n\n## Learning objectives\n\n-   Recognize the **history of DevOps.**\n-   Differentiate between **DevOps** (knowledge, practices, and tools) and **IT/Admins** (people and roles).\n-   Recognize **red flags about IT/Admin functions** and what they might indicate.\n-   Organize the content that will be **covered in this book.**\n\n## Devops?\n\n-   Grew out of **Agile software development (2001).**\n    -   Deliver small units, collect feedback, iterate.\n-   Needed similar process to **get the iterations deployed.**\n-   **DevOps (~2010)** is the **system/discipline.**\n\n## DevOps vs IT/Admins\n\n-   **DevOps** \n    -   Knowledge, practices, & tools\n    -   Put things into prod\n    -   Safely & easily\n-   **IT/Admins**\n    -   People/roles who manage the servers, etc.\n    -   Many names:\n        -   Information Technology (IT)\n        -   SysAdmin\n        -   Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)\n        -   DevOps\n        -   Subdivisions (see next slide)\n\n## Red Flags about IT/Admins\n\n1. **Subdivided** (security, databases, networking, etc)\n    -   **Pros:** Super-deep expertise.\n    -   **Cons:** Hard to find the right person.\n2. **Outsourced**\n    -   **Pros:** Companies can get competence fast.\n    -   **Cons:** Scheduling, often high turnover.\n3. **Nobody**\n    -   **Pros:** Freedom!\n    -   **Cons:** It's all up to you!\n\n## This Book\n\n-   **Section 1:** Patterns & principles to grease the path to production.\n-   **Section 2:** Vocab & beginnings of DIY.\n-   **Section 3:** Hands-on DIY. Still very very in progress.\n\n## DevOps Lessons for Data Science\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n\n-   Describe the **core principles of DevOps.**\n-   Apply **DevOps best practices** to **data science.**\n\n\n## The 5 Tenets of DevOps\n\n1.  Code should be **well-tested** and tests should be **automated.**\n2.  **Updates** should be **frequent** and **low-risk.**\n3.  **Security** concerns should be considered **up front as part of architecture.**\n4.  **Production** systems should have **monitoring and logging.**\n5.  Frequent opportunities for **review, change, and updating** should be **built into the system** -- both **culturally** and **technically.**\n\n## DevOps for Data Science\n\n-   **Use CI/CD ‚û°Ô∏è Code Promotion and Integration Processes**\n    -   Structure output so moving to prod or updating is easy.\n-   **Infrastructure as Code ‚û°Ô∏è Manage Environments as Code**\n    -   Reproducible & secure environments are... reproducible and secure!\n-   **Microservices ‚û°Ô∏è Data Science Project Components**\n    -   Figure out how to subdivide things to make updating less painful.\n-   **Monitoring & Logging ‚û°Ô∏è Monitoring & Logging**\n    -   Data science doesn't do enough of this, but he'll tell us how we should!\n-   **Other Things ‚û°Ô∏è Other Things üôÉ**\n    -   Chapter about Docker for Data Science here, because it deserves its own chapter.\n    -   Section 2 will be all about things like communication, collaboration, and review practices.",
