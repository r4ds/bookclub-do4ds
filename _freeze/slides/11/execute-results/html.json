When a process ends, it is destroyed (like when you quit RStudio)\n\n- Get a computer with lots of RAM, probably\n\n$\\textrm{Necessary RAM} = \\textrm{max amount of data} \\times 3$\n\n- If it's too big, move to disk (e.g. database, Arrow, dask, HDF5)\n\n![Big data in R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2019-07-01-3-big-data-paradigms-for-r_files/chunk_pull.png)\n\n## Disk (Storage) {-}\n\n- Where physical files live and persist\n\n- The bigger the better (and cheaper nowadays)\n\n$\\textrm{Necessary Storage} = \\textrm{approx data} + 1 \\textrm{GB} \\times n \\textrm{ users}$\n\n- Disk types:\n    - HDD: mechanical, slower, cheaper\n\n    - SSD: electronic, faster, more expensive\n\n## GPU {-}\n\n- Specialized chips initially built for graphics\n\n- More numerous slower cores than CPU\n\n> Where a consumer-grade CPU has 4-16 cores, mid-range GPUs have 700-4,000 cores, but each one runs between 1% and 10% the speed of a CPU core.\n\n- Great for parallelisation (think Neural Nets)\n\n## So Should I Get  GPU...? {-}\n\n- Usually, no (parallelising into < 10 workers is often enough)\n\n- You'll know you need a GPU when you get there\n\n- _Discuss..._\n\n![decisions, decisions](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/ayh7r7g0ty.jpg)\n\n\n## Scenarios {-}\n\n1. You try to load a big csv file into pandas in Python. It churns for a while and then crashes.\n\n2. You go to build a new ML model on your data. You’d like to re-train the model once a day, but it turns out training this model takes 26 hours on your laptop.\n\n3. You design an visualization Matplotlib , and create a whole bunch in a loop, you want to parallelize the operation. Right now you’re running on a t2.small with 1 CPU.\n\n## Lab {-}\n\nNot much to say here...🤷\n",
