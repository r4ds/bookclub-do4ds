Laptop → Server\n-   **outbound/forward proxy:** routes traffic *out of* a private network. Server → API\n\n![Proxies](images/15_traffic.png)\n\n## Benefits of Private Networks {-}\n\n-   Deal with security issues at the proxies\n-   Use private IP addresses internally\n-   Easier to route traffic (and change routing) to specific servers\n-   Easier to manage ports\n-   Can block traffic to/from specific unwanted sources\n    -   Or block all traffic and only allow specific white lists\n-   Can optionally handle authentication at the proxy & pass token/header along\n\n## Issues with Inbound Proxies {-}\n\n- Connections from your laptop to the server\n- Correct port configuration is critical\n-   Things that are often configured:\n    -   Upload/download file size limits.\n    -   Upload/download/session timeouts.\n-   Signs that you might be fighting against an inbound proxy:\n    -   Uploads/downloads from you to the server fail or cut off early.\n    -   Your session keeps ending (you have to log back in).\n\n## Issues with Outbound Proxies {-}\n\n-   Connections from server to the internet\n-   Rarer than inbound.\n    -   \"Air-gapped\" often means \"strong outbound proxy.\"\n-   Things that can be impacted:\n    -   Downloading packages (other than from internal package manager).\n    -   Accessing external data (APIs).\n    -   Updating system libraries (hopefully your IT has a plan for this).\n    -   Software licensing (software might ping a server).\n-   IT often open to allowing access to specific URLs, so ask!\n",
