Because you want to be this guy.

*Let's discuss this and fill in some reasons?

## Selecting your terminal

As a Mac user Alex recommends using the built-in app, Terminal, so do I!

iTerm 2 for multiple tabs, theming and other niceties. Has anyone used this, anything to add?

Same for Windows! 

Any thoughts here, disagreements, recommendations?

Shoutouts for zsh, Ksh, and Fish.
