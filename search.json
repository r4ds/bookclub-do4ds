    "text": "How to Scale and Stabilize Workloads in Enterprise-Level Organisations\n\nVertical Scaling Limitations and Horizontal Scaling to the rescue\n\nBefore attempting horizontal scaling, it is usually always good to exhaust the portion of vertical scaling where costs climb linearly with computation.\n\nHigh Availability is achieved by\n\nUsing Load balancers in Horizontal scaling\n\nImagine a restaurant with one chef that is trying to serve meals to a hundred customers at once.\n\nThe chef can only cook one meal at a time, so the customers are getting frustrated with long wait times and some of them are leaving.This is because the chef is overloaded and cannot handle the intense workload.\nNow, imagine the restaurant hires three more chefs, all with the same skills and equipment as the first chef. The restaurant invests in a system where each chef has a buzzer that goes off when there are new orders waiting for them. The buzzer ensures that each chef knows exactly when they need to start cooking a new meal, and they do not get overwhelmed by too many orders at once.\nIn this analogy, the chefs represent servers or clusters, and the buzzer represents a load balancer.\n\n\nMaintaining a backup of the load balancer and the database/NAS.\n\n\n\n\nAdding Autoscaling (i.e. you save money when traffic is low)\n\nMany autoscaling frameworks these days assume that applications are mostly stateless."

    "text": "Facilitating Enterprise Workloads Management with Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes solves all three of the key enterprise IT/Admin challenges with running servers.\nIncreasing the processing power of your cluster is usually as simple as a few mouse clicks. On the other side, this makes it risky from a cost perspective.\nHelm is the standard tool for defining what’s running in the cluster.\nInstead of the ten steps required in a typical server-based deployment. There are just three steps for Kubernetes.\nWhat are the biggest strengths of Kubernetes as a scaling tool? What are some drawbacks?\n\nStrengths:\n\nAutomatic Load Balancing\nHorizontal Scaling\nInfrastructure Agnosticism\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nManaging and maintaining a Kubernetes cluster can be complex and time-consuming and really requires a highly competent Kubernetes admin\nNetworking in Kubernetes can also be quite complicated."
