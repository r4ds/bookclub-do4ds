## Learning objectives

-   Recognize **why** you might (and might not) want to **host services in the cloud.**
-   Differentiate between **IaaS, PaaS,** and **SaaS.**
-   List some **common cloud services.**
-   Start and stop an **EC2 instance** on AWS.

## Quick Section Overview

> So this section is really targeting the student who wants to **host a project for portfolio purposes,** the hobbyist who's **hosting a toy project,** or the data science leader who **has no choice but to host things for themselves because they just can't get IT/Admin support.**

## Why cloud?

- Flexibility: easy to re-scale.
- No need to manage hardware.
- Cheaper? 
    - Not so much

## Things as a Service

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS, "eye-az")** 

- *Rent a server*
- It is actually a **VM**: a virtualized server on a virtual machine, called an instance. 
- **Spot instances**: for stateless, fault-tolerant applications. 
    - Cheaper, they lend you space no one is using.
    - Preemptible, they can be claimed back.

## Things as a Service 

**Platform as a Service (PaaS, "pass")** 

- They manage the servers AND your applications. 
- You get a ready to use environment for your applications. 
- Examples:
    - Blob storage
    - Lambdas, *serverless* functions
    - Container orchestration, Kubernetes
- Posit Connect Cloud


## Things as a Service
**Software as a Service (SaaS, "sass")** 

- You rent the end-user software. 
- Data as a service?
