title: You should use SSL/HTTPS
---

## Learning objectives

-   Details that we won't dig into:
    -   Identify the problems that SSL/https are meant to solve.
    -   Explain how SSL/https solve those problems.
-   Configure SSL on an AWS EC2.
    -   Configure nginx to identify your domain name.
    -   Use `certbot` to set up SSL.
    -   Update the `rstudio` configuration in `nginx` to support `https`.
    -   Open the necessary ports on your EC2's security group.

## Get ready {-}

-   If you've followed the instructions from Chapter 13, you're ready to go!
-   Make sure you have this line in `nginx.conf`: 
    -   `server_name yourdomain.you www.yourdomain.you;`

## certbot {-}

-   `sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx`
-   `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
-   `sudo certbot –nginx -d yourdomain.you -d www.yourdomain.you`

## rstudio in nginx.conf {-}

-   `sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
-   `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;` in the `rstudio` location
-   `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

## Open the port {-}

(you may have already set this up in Chapter 12)

-   *(Log into console.aws.amazon.com and navigate to EC2/Instances)*
-   Click the "Security" tab on your instance.
-   Click the Security group (something like `launch-wizard-2`)
    -   (or go directly to "Network & Security"/"Security Groups")
-   "Inbound rules" > "Edit inbound rules"
-   "Add rule"
    -   "HTTPS", "Anywhere-IPv4"
-   Discussion: Leave HTTP, probably?
-   Visit `https://yourdomain.you/rstudio`, `http://yourdomain.you/rstudio`, etc.
