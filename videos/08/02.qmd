00:03:49	Umair Durrani:	Start
00:18:04	Arthur Shaw:	Really strange the chapter didn't discuss Vim (unless I missed it).
00:19:52	Diana Garcia Cortes:	I didn't think about it but yes! It should be there
00:21:40	Arthur Shaw:	I will need to drop off in a bit to join a last-minute work call. But I wonder if anyone has experience with Tailscale (https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale)--and any info on whether it's better somehow that vanilla SSH. I've been seeing Tailscale mentioned a lot of late.
00:21:56	Tan:	https://do4ds.com/chapters/sec2/2-4-app-admin.html#configuration-with-vim-and-nano  vim covered a little later
00:22:16	Tan:	tailscale is great, but it's not the same thing as vanilla SSH
00:22:22	Diana Garcia Cortes:	Reacted to "https://do4ds.com/ch..." with 👍

00:23:02	Diana Garcia Cortes:	Reacted to "also hiya folks" with 👋
00:28:37	Diana Garcia Cortes:	Does anyone know why ssh is not the default protocol to use github with usethis or git2r?
00:30:17	Diana Garcia Cortes:	Replying to "Does anyone know why..."

just cause it requires more configuration? or are there some advantages when using https?
00:30:27	Arthur Shaw:	The chapter mentioned tmux / terminal multiplexers fairly quickly. I've tinkered a bit with tmux and zellij for local stuff. I wonder if others have found it useful for connecting to and interacting with remote servers.
00:31:20	Tan:	https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html#https-vs-ssh 
ssh is harder to set up right on windows, and also once you set up https creds it lets you use gh api stuff as well e.g. pak/remotes installs
00:31:32	Arthur Shaw:	Reacted to "just cause it requir..." with 👀
00:31:52	Tan:	if that continues try checking the aws firewall
00:32:11	Arthur Shaw:	(Gotta drop for a work call. I cannot wait to see the recording of the rest of today's session.)
00:32:34	Diana Garcia Cortes:	Replying to "The chapter mentione..."

I've used screen. It is useful
00:32:57	Diana Garcia Cortes:	Reacted to "https://usethis.r-li..." with 👍

00:36:01	Umair Durrani:	Stop
